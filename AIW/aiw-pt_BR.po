"Damage coefficient (see melee or ranged attack calculation scheme first) is calculated from the number of soldiers of your troop and enemy troop. If you have many vanguards than enemy, your coeffient becomes large and the enemy one becomes small. This value is calculated individually for vanguards and shooters. Thus, coefficients of melee and ranged are usually different. Note that <b>RIDERs usually do not contribute to that coefficient</b>.\n"
