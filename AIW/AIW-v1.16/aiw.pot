"I hate wars, but I have anticipated this new war, I made preparations for war during these two years. Both of the former outposts have been restored as small forts, and the North fort next to the River is rebuilt as a small castle. But the east and west sides are not yet well-guarded. We have a lot of things to do. Honestly, the war itself is within the range of my prediction, but I did not think this land is involved again. There are many other unexpected, unwelcome things. The most unexpected fact among them is ..."

"Kingdom recently changed their attitude towards non-human races... This wording is not quite correct, because their attitude towards elves and dwarves did not change significantly. Anyway, the problem is their attitude towards races such as goblins, nagas, and saurians. Kingdom commanded me to forfeit all rights of them without providing any reasons. I asked the government for the reason and purpose... what I got from the officer was just a waste of the time. I had been negotiating patiently with them, but in vain."

Kingdom, Empire, and all their allies are the enemies. Such war is apparently ridiculous. I will surely die in this war, but our ideals will stay longer in this world and will change something."
